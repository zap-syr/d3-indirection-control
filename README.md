If you have Elgato StreamDeck and you want to use him instead of use this application you can easily export config file for [Bitfocus Companion](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion) with already predefined buttons.

Before exporting config file set text color and background color and adjust text alignment with size. Press "Export config" button and save config at your PC.

Go to Companion and launch UI, go to import/export tab and import your saved config.

It'll add new OSC Generic connection in Companion and will create buttons with names of your files.
